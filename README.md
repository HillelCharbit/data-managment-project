### Introduction

The **Voronoi Unrepresented Data Identifier** is a data management tool designed to analyze and detect gaps in data representation within a given dataset. Utilizing Voronoi diagrams, this tool identifies areas where additional data collection could significantly enhance machine learning model performance.

### Features

- **Voronoi Diagram Generation**: Generate Voronoi diagrams to visualize data distribution.
- **Unrepresented Region Detection**: Identify regions lacking sufficient data representation.
- **Data Visualization**: Display Voronoi diagrams and highlight unrepresented regions for easy analysis.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

After installation, you can run the project using:
```bash
python main.py
```
This command will initiate the Voronoi diagram generation process and identify unrepresented data regions within your dataset.

### Class Descriptions

#### Main

The **Main** class manages the workflow, executing Voronoi diagram generation and unrepresented region detection.

#### DataManager

Handles data input and management, organizing datasets for analysis.

#### Polygon

The **Polygon** class represents polygons formed from Voronoi cells and provides methods for geometric operations on these polygons.

#### VorCell

Manages individual Voronoi cells, including their creation and the calculation of unrepresented regions within each cell.

#### VoronoiLines

Processes datasets to prepare them for Voronoi diagram generation.
